# Tables for accessibility

## Brief

1. The HTML and CSS files were provided
2. Add the appropriate scope attributes to make this table more accessible
3. Finally, try making another copy of the starter files, and this time make the table more accessible by creating precise and explicit associations using id and headers attributes.

## My Biggest Learnings

1. How to structure a table for better accesibility
2. Identifying how useful id's and headers are especially as tables get more complicated.
